![QWatson - A simple Qt-GUI for the Watson time-tracker](
./qwatson/ressources/qwatson_banner.png)

QWatson is a simple GUI entirely written in Python with [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the [Watson CLI time tracker](http://tailordev.github.io/Watson/) developed by [TailorDev](https://tailordev.fr). It is inspired by the time tracker developed by [Project Hamster](https://github.com/projecthamster/) that I love and used for several years when I was working in Linux. Unfortunately, I was not able to find any open source equivalent for the Windows platform and decided to write my own when I learned about the existence of Watson.

Many thanks to [TailorDev](https://tailordev.fr) for sharing their awesome work.
